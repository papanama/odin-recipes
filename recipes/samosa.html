    <p>Samosa is a popular Indian snack made of a crispy pastry filled with 
        a savory mixture of spiced potatoes, peas, and sometimes meat. They 
        are typically deep-fried until golden brown and served with chutney or
        sauce. Samosas are often enjoyed as a snack or appetizer and are a
        staple in Indian cuisine.</p>

        <li>Oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: Mix all-purpose flour with a pinch of salt and enough
            water to form a smooth dough. Let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: In a pan, heat some oil and add cumin seeds.
            Add the boiled and mashed potatoes, green peas, and spices. Cook until well
            combined and flavorful. Let it cool.</li>
        <li>Shape the samosas: Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball
            into a thin oval shape. Cut it in half to form two semicircles. Take
            one semicircle, fold it into a cone shape, and seal the edges. Fill the
            cone with the potato filling and seal the top edge.</li>
        <li>Fry the samosas: Heat oil in a deep pan. Fry the samosas in batches
            until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels
            to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve hot: Enjoy the samosas with mint chutney or tamarind
            sauce as a dipping option.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your homemade samosas!</p>
