        <p>Mutton biryani is a layered rice dish cooked with marinated
        mutton(goat meat), long-grain basmati rice (or other suitable
        rice variety), and a blend of aromatic spices. The dish is 
        typically slow-cooked in a sealed pot in a method called
        "dum-style", which allows the flavors to meld beautifully and 
        the meat to become tender. </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Marination: Mutton pieces are marinated with yogurt, 
                spices, herbs, and lemon juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rice Preparation: Basmati rice is washed and soaked, 
                then partially cooked with whole spices until al dente 
                (firm to the bite).
            </li>
            <li>
                Meat Preparation: The marinated mutton is cooked until 
                tender, either in a pressure cooker or a heavy-bottomed 
                pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Layering: The cooked mutton and par-cooked rice are layered 
                in a pot, interspersed with fried onions, herbs, and saffron 
                milk (if using).
            </li>
            <li>
                Dum Cooking: The pot is sealed tightly and slow-cooked over 
                a low flame, allowing the flavors to penetrate the rice and 
                meat. 
            </li>
        </ol>
